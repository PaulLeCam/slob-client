<p>Slob is a set of simple RequireJS modules made to abstract librairies such as LoDash, jQuery, Backbone, Handlebars... and assemble them into a framework and other components to ensure modularity of application code.</p>

<h2 id="previous-work">Previous work</h2>

<p>Slob is based on best-practices articles and presentations, most notably:</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="work-in-progress">Work in progress</h2>

<p>This code is still in very early development, it requires lots of testing and is not appropriate for production applications.
Future developments will focus on adding tests and examples.</p>

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>

<p>Slob architecture is made of 3 parts, defining 3 layers of abstraction:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <em>core</em> is made to abstract librairies and eventually split of assemble them into different functionalities. It also offers basic implementations of different design patterns and general-purpose utilities.</li>
<li>The <em>extension</em> purpose is to augment the core functionalities and provide new ones to match the needs of the application, assembled in a simple framework and a mediator.</li>
<li>The <em>sandboxes</em> purpose is to provide a limited API of the core and framework functionalities to the actual application modules depending on their role, such as services (no access to the DOM) and widgets (user-facing functionalities).</li>
</ul>
